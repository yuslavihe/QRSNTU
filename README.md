## 🔬 Core Focus Areas

### 1. Academic Research
- Conduct original quantitative research across mathematics, economics, finance, and computational sciences.
- Collaborate with faculty, graduate students, and external partners on papers, competitions, and publications.

### 2. Specialised Learning
- Organise advanced workshops and mini-courses (e.g. functional analysis, convex optimisation, dynamic portfolio optimisation).
- Provide a platform for undergraduates to engage with graduate-level quantitative theory.

### 3. Knowledge Sharing
- Publish high-quality notes, guides, and problem sets for NTU courses.
- Develop open resources for the NTU community to explore advanced quantitative learning.

### 4. Outreach & Impact
- Host seminars, talks, and reading groups with guest speakers from academia and industry.
- Encourage interdisciplinary applications (finance, data science, operations research, etc.).

## 🚀 Flagship Project: [ntuinfo.com](https://ntuinfo.com)
- Designed a **quantitative scoring framework** for 100+ student clubs using multi-criteria optimization (mental load, physical load, difficulty).
- Built a **bilingual English/Chinese full-stack Java application** to consolidate campus resources into algorithmically ranked recommendations.
- Led **end-to-end project delivery**: requirements → algorithm design → GitHub deployment.
