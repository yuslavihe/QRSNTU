# ðŸ“‹ Application Prerequisite Guidelines â€” Quantitative Research Society \@NTU
_Published on September 14, 2025_

 Quantitative Research Society \@NTU is an advanced, research-focused society. To ensure applicants are prepared for the rigor of our workshops, all applicants must complete foundational coursework in **mathematics, statistics, and programming**.

Applicants may satisfy prerequisites through:

* **Equivalent NTU undergraduate modules** (see [NTU SPMS course list](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/spms/about-us/mathematics/undergrad/course-info)), or
* **Approved external MOOCs** (listed below).

All prerequisites must be completed for a **letter grade (B or above)** or an official **certificate of completion**.

To apply, you must complete **one course in each mandatory category (Math, Stats, Programming)**. Completion of recommended or advanced preparation courses may allow applicants to **start directly in Semester 2 or 3, or participate in research projects immediately**.
